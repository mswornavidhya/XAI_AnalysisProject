XAI Analysis for heart disease prediction

**Description:** Approximately, 31% of total deaths worldwide are caused by cardiovascular diseases in the past few decades. Heart attacks are also called cardiac arrests. Several cardiovascular diseases can be linked to revised risk factors, most of which are preventable. ML model algorithms are built to determine the risk factors and classify the person as likely to have a heart attack or not. With the aid of XAI, a human interprets a risk factor predicted based on an analysis of XAI Frameworks
